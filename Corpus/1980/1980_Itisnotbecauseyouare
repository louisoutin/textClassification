It is not because you are

When I have rencontred you,
You was a jeune fille au pair,
And I put a spell on you,
And you roule a pelle to me.

Together we go partout
On my mob il was super
It was friday on my mind,
It was story d'amour.

It is not because you are,
I love you because I do
C'est pas parc' que you are me qu'I am you.

You was really beautiful
In the middle of the foule.
Don't let me misunderstood,
Don't let me sinon I boude.

My loving, my marshmallow,
You are belle and I are beau
You give me all what You have
I say thank you, you are bien brave.

It is not because you are,
I love you because I do
C'est pas parc'que you are me qu'I am you.

I wanted marry with you,
And make love very beaucoup,
To have a max of children,
Just like Stone and Charden.

But one day that must arrive,
Together we disputed.
For a stupid story of fric,
We decide to divorced.

It is not because you are,
I love you because I do
C'est pas parc' que you are me qu'I am you.

You chialed comme une madeleine,
Not me, I have my dignité.
You tell me : you are a sale mec !
I tell you : poil to the bec !

That's comme ça that you thank me
To have learning you english ?
Eh ! That's not you qui m'a appris,
My grand father was rosbeef !

It is not because you are,
I love you because I do
C'est pas parc' que you are me qu'I am you.
